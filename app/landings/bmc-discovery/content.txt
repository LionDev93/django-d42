Looking for a better BMC Discovery (ADDM) alternative? Device42 helps you with an automatically generated, centralized repository of application, service and device relationships and dependencies whether running on premises on physical machines, on virtual machines, or in the cloud. And you can do all of that agent-lessly and without any expensive packet captures.

- Agentless services and application discovery combines data obtained via Windows (WMI) and Linux (SSH) protocols, and augments this native-protocol deep application discovery with netflow
- Get a list of all deployed applications, manufacturer, version number
- Get a list of all services, running or not, users, protocols & ports
- Easily view application to server and application to application mapping
- View comprehensive application dependency maps even for machines that can't be directly accessed, built out with Netflow data!
