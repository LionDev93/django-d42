GDPR Compliance requirements take effect on May 25, 2018 - Device42's comprehensive IT inventory management and audit capabilities, including powerful auto-discovery and fully configurable asset types help you get and stay GDPR compliant!
You’re required to comply with GDPR regulations if you:

- Have a presence in an EU-Member Country
- Processes personal data of (EU) European residents
- Employ more than 250 persons
- Or employ fewer than 250 persons, but process data that has an impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects, is not occasional, or includes certain types of sensitive data
<i>(This last one applies to pretty much everyone else!)</i>
