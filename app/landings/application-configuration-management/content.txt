- Powerful visualizations to make quick business decisions and quickly find impacts of different CIs to other CIs.
- Out-of-the-box integrations with ITSM tools like JIRA, ServiceNow, Cherwell and many more help you enhance the value of your existing investments.
- REST APIs to build quick integrations with homegrown and external tools whether it is another CMDB, automation or other tools.
