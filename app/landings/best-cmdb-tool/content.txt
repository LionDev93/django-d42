Generic and/or open-source CMDB software leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to auto-discovery and dependency mapping. If you're looking to understand and control your infrastructure, let Device42 generate dependency maps that highlight key relationships and interdependencies for you!

- Agentless service and application dependency discovery via native Windows (WMI) and Linux (SSH) protocols, and via SNMP for network hardware
- Device42 discovers all of your deployed hardware, software, manufacturers, and versions and stores details in a built in CMDB
- Complete server and service dependencies, protocols, and ports are all discovered automatically
- Easily view application to application and to server dependency maps
- View comprehensive application dependency maps even for machines that can't be directly accessed, built out with Netflow data!
