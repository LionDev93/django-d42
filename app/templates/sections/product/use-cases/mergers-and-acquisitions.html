Because of this, the process involves in depth planning, testing, and careful execution, as neither party was likely at all familiar with the others infrastructure before the merger or acquisition. There is also can exist much risk and many unknowns when merging AD forests and domain trusts, for example, as this grants various access rights across unfamiliar domains." %}</p>

Tired of playing <em>“who knows the password”</em>? You don’t have to do that anymore if you have Device42. When planning IP allocations, view network diagrams and fragmentation charts or just click the <em>“What’s the next available IP”</em> button, courtesy of  Device42 IPAM.

Network SNMP discovery inventories switches, routers, and firewalls, and can even work out IP to MAC relationships to map MAC addresses to physical ports.
