We have been using spreadsheets for a long time and our growth just made it no longer feasible to manage technology in this manner. We have been a Solar Winds customer for quite some time, but that product pales in comparison. What attracted us to Device42 was the UCS, Cisco ACI, and VMware integration. For us this was critical. We also utilized your dev team during the past month with at least 4-5 bugs that we uncovered during our POC. They immediately turned around code for us – and have made that standard in the next release. This was quite impressive. We were not even a customer and you were partnering with us to solve problems. We also are a Service NOW shop so this product will help with IP management during our new client build and deployment processes. We also love the data center integration piece where we can literally detail with a drawn VISIO to the actual port ID where a circuit is plugged in. This entire “data center single piece of glass” is what we were looking for.<br><br>As an Enterprise Cloud Provider, we are happy we have made this decision!' %}
