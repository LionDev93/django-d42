                        <p>{% blocktrans %}5. <strong>Rights, Title, and Interest to Intellectual Property.</strong> Except for the license conveyed herein, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software, Documentation, and corresponding intellectual property shall remain in Device42 or its suppliers or are publicly available. The Software and Documentation are protected by the copyright and intellectual property laws of the United States and international copyright and intellectual property laws and treaties. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by Device42, its suppliers, or third parties.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}6. <strong>Limited Warranties; Exclusions.</strong> Device42 warrants to Licensee that for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery of the Software to Licensee that the Software will perform substantially in conformance with the Documentation. Device42 does not warrant that the Software will meet all of Licensee’s requirements or that the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. The foregoing warranty applies only to failures in operation of the Software that are reproducible in standalone form and does not apply to: (i) a failure by Licensee to operate the Software within the systems requirements provided for the Software or Licensee’s use of the Software in combination with other products not provided or expressly approved by Device42; (ii) Software that is modified or altered by Licensee or any third party that is not authorized, in writing, by Device42; (iii) Software that is operated in violation of this Agreement or other than in accordance with the Documentation; (iv) failures that are caused by other software or hardware products; or (v) Licensee’s failure or refusal to implement maintenance releases. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, as Device42 and its supplier’s entire liability, and as Licensee’s exclusive remedy for any breach of the foregoing warranty, Device42 will, at its sole option and expense, promptly repair or replace any Software that fails to meet this limited warranty or, if Device42 is unable to repair or replace the Software, terminate the license and refund to Licensee a pro-rated portion of the applicable license fees for the period following termination, which shall be paid upon return of the nonconforming item to Device42. The warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement Software will be warranted for 30 days.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}7. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DEVICE42 BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE, IN THE AGGREGATE, FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE FEES THAT LICENSEE HAS PAID TO DEVICE42 IN THE PRECEDING SIX (6) MONTHS OR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF DEVICE42 HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT LIMIT LIABILITY FOR BODILY INJURY OR DEATH AS A RESULT OF DEVLICE42’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT SUCH LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}8. <strong>IP Indemnity.</strong> Device42 shall defend Licensee against any third party claim that Licensee’s use of the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement infringes any U.S. copyright, trademark or patent, and Device42 will indemnify Licensee against damages awarded on any such claim, provided that Device42 is promptly notified of any such claim and given reasonable assistance (at Device42’s expense) with, and sole control over, the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise. Failure to so notify Device42 shall not relieve Device42 of its obligation to indemnify Licensee except to the extent such failure to notify shall have materially impaired Device42’s ability to defend against the claim. Device42 will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. In the event that Licensee’s use of the Software is determined to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights, Device42 will, at its option, and at no cost to Licensee, either (a) procure a license enabling Licensee to continue to use the Software, (b) replace the Software with substantially equivalent software, or (c) terminate this Agreement and refund a pro-rated portion of the fee paid by Licensee hereunder for the period following termination, which shall be paid upon return of the Software to Device42. The obligations of Device42 under this Section 8 do not apply with respect to Software or portions or components thereof (1) that are modified or altered by Licensee or any third party that is not authorized, in writing, by Device42, (2) that are combined with other products, processes or materials to the extent that the alleged infringement is based on such combination, (3) to the extent that Licensee continued allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or of the availability of maintenance releases or other modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (4) where Licensee uses the Software in violation of this Agreement or other than in accordance with the Documentation. This Section sets forth Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and Device42’s sole obligation with respect to claims of infringement.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}9. <strong>Licensee&rsquo;s Indemnity.</strong> Licensee is responsible for the consequences of its use of the Software. Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Device42, and any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, suppliers, resellers or agents, from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) based on any claim brought by a third party, arising from Licensee's use or modification of the Software except to the extent Device42 is required to indemnify Licensee under Section 8, provided that Licensee is promptly notified of any and all such claims and given reasonable assistance (at Licensee’s expense) with, and sole control over, the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise. Failure to so notify Licensee shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to indemnify Device42 except to the extent such failure to notify shall have materially impaired Licensee’s ability to defend against the claim. Licensee will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}10. <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Licensee will treat the Software as a trade secret and proprietary information belonging to Device42 that is being made available to Licensee in confidence. Licensee agrees to treat the Software with at least the same care as it treats its own highly confidential or proprietary information, but not less than reasonable care. Device42 will not use any information provided by Licensee that is marked confidential or that a reasonable person would presume is confidential for any purpose other than to provide the Software and Maintenance under this Agreement. Further, Device42 will restrict disclosure of such confidential information to employees or contractors of Device42 who have a need to know such information for purposes of this Agreement.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}11. <strong>Support and Maintenance terms and conditions.</strong>{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}11.1 Maintenance Services. Device42 agrees to provide to Licensee, during the validity of the license and term of this Agreement, support and maintenance (collectively "Maintenance") as follows:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

                        <p>{% blocktrans %}11.3 Maintenance: Device42 will supply, at no additional charge, any improvements, upgrades, or modifications to the Software that Device42 makes generally available.

                        <p>{% blocktrans %}11.4 Exclusions. Device42's obligation to provide Support is contingent upon proper use of the Software and full compliance with this Agreement. Moreover, Device42 shall be under no obligation to provide Support should such services be required due to (a) failure to operate the Software within the systems requirements provided for the Software or use of the Software in combination with other products not provided or expressly approved by Device42 (b) any modification or attempted modification of the Software by Licensee or any third party that is not authorized, in writing, by Device42 (c) Licensee's failure or refusal to implement maintenance releases(d) Software that is operated in violation of this Agreement or other than in accordance with the Documentation or Device42’s written instructions, or (e) failures that are caused by other software or hardware products.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}12. <strong>Termination.</strong> Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing Device42 with at least 10 days written notice of termination. Device42 may terminate this Agreement, including the license hereunder, if Licensee fails to comply with any of its terms and does not cure the same, if curable, within 10 days after receiving written notice thereof.  Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee’s license under this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action required on the part of Device42 if Licensee uses the Software outside of the scope of its license or violates its confidentiality obligations.  Device42 shall have the right to audit Licensee’s use of the Software during the term of this Agreement and for two (2) years following termination.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}13. <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions, and such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect while most nearly adhering to the intent expressed herein. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions, except that the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. Licensee hereby consents to jurisdiction of the courts of the state and federal courts in or near New Haven County, Connecticut. Licensee may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder without Device42’s prior written consent. The provisions of Sections 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
                        <p>{% blocktrans %}14. <strong>Complete Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof including without limitation any purchase order issued in connection with this Agreement unless otherwise expressly agreed by Device42 in such purchase order or other written document.  No waiver shall be enforceable against Device42 unless it is in a writing signed by Device42.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
